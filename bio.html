                            <p>Hello My name is Mary Gene R. Javier. I am currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology as a second-year student in Pangasinan State University-Urdaneta Campus. I grew up as an only girl and youngest in our family. Since my brothers are college graduates, I am the only one who's still studying. <p>
                            <p>In elementary, I have studied in Villasis I Central School. Since Grade 1 to Grade 5, I belong to the SPED section (Special Education), but during my elementary days, I am not that studious type of student. So, I am wondering if how did I survived in SPED class for about how many school years. Honestly, I really don’t have interest in studying before because I am more focused in playing and watching cartoons which is I think as a normal habit because I’m still young. Until I reached in Grade 5, I noticed that my grades were in danger, so as a result I demoted to regular class. It’s such a big slap for me back then. I cried so hard and I feel so embarrassed for what happened. There are lots of realizations and regrets that keeps on running through my mind, so I promised to myself that even though I am not a SPED student anymore, I will correct all my mistakes by studying hard. So in Grade 6, all my hard works had been paid off. I am awarded as 1st honor in our class (regular class). During this moment, I’ve realized that if I wasn’t demoted, I will not wake up from the reality. I am thankful for what happened because it taught me lots of things.</p>
                            <p>In my junior high school years, I’ve studied in Don Ramon E. Costales Memorial National High School. Because of the thought of being afraid to fail once again, I studied hard. I showed my determination in our class during Grade 7 days, so later on I became 2nd place, during this moment only the first honor will be awarded so I don’t have any medals to receive. When I turned in Grade 8 to Grade 9, I don’t have any awards because I am supposed to be always in honor list but I am always defeated by others because of their extra-curricular. In grade 10, I tried my best to be in the honor list so aside from studying well, I also joined some extra-curricular in our school. I joined drum and lyre and street dancing. Doing multitasks were not easy but in the end, all of my hard works has been paid off. I am awarded as 10th honor in 1st section. </p>
                            <p>During my senior high school years I transferred to Pangasinan State University-Urdaneta Campus, being able to compete within myself became hard. Maybe because of the school environment plus the standard of the school were hard to fulfill. Because of my previous achievements, my family’s expectation became higher so I’m just too pressured to meet my family’s expectations. So even if it’s hard for me to be in the honor list, I did my very best to be in that place. I put so much efforts in everything I do in our school activities. And with that, and the end of the Grade 11 school year I am one of those 2nd places since we have lots of tie. </p>
                            <p>In Grade 12, since it is our last stage of being high school, I am getting more excited to graduate and experience college life. What matters for me during this time is to graduate and not to be in the honor list again. Being able to learn and get a passing grade were enough for me to be proud of because I know that I have done enough.</p>
                            <p>And now I’m already in my college years, I decided to pursue my degree in PSU-Urdaneta, I regret of being so excited to be adult. The awards, the knowledge and experiences I have earned during my elementary and high school years are all useless. The environment and competence in college are high, there’s so much pressure I have encountered during my freshmen years. I thought that I am ready to be in college since I have been through a lot during senior high school but I just realized that these are not enough to survive. I cried a lot due to pressure and difficulties during my freshmen years, until I have found God. I joined bible studies in our school and it encourages me a lot to hold on and set my self from being so hard on myself. What encourages me more is that I am almost on my mid-way before I graduate college. Being 2nd year college student is hard yet a little bit exciting because I am getting to use of the difficulties little by little.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my student life, it made me realize that learning is really a hard process. We should not rush the things that are still present, let us learn to treasure, enjoy on the present and be ready for the future. Because life is full of surprises, we don’t know what happens next. The most important thing is <strong>don’t lose hope because God is always with you.</strong></p>
